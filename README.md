# Cash Classifiers: Grouping Customers, One Transaction at a Time
This project aims to do a simples customer segmentation based bank transactions. Most banks have a large customer base - with different characteristics. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits. Customer Segmentation will help buisiness learn about customers more deeply, in order to know how to market and sell their projects, which customers to invest in and how to improve the buisiness marketing techniques.

## Description and Objectives
The need to build this project is to both learn and show what I am capable of doing in the Data Science and Machine Learning fields.

This is a very simple project where the end goal is to build a dashboard where everyone can segment their own customers, in the meantime, I want to answer some questions inherited to customer data, based on the EDA.



## Roadmap

- Data Collecting

- Data Preprocessing

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Clustering the data with Machine Learning

- Interpretation and Discussion of results

- Build and deploy the dashboard


## Questions

 ###    What is the use of Machine Learning in banking?
Machine Learning is extensively used in banking for tasks like credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and personalized marketing. For instance, machine learning models often surpass traditional methods in accurately predicting credit risk and identifying fraud by analysing real-time transaction patterns. These application highlight the increasing role of Machine Learning in imporving decision-making and customer engagement within the banking industry.

### What is the importance of Customer Segmentation in banking?
Customer segmentation has been a key strategy in the banking sector, traditionally based on demographic factors like age, income, and location to classify customers. However, with the rise of big data and advanced analytics, these traditional approaches are being superseded by more advanced machine learning techniques. These new methods allow banks to process large datasets and reveal intricate patterns in customer behavior that were previously out of reach.
